# MedTrackr

A Flutter-based medication tracking app to manage medications, dosages, schedules, and history.

## Notes for Grok

- **Date of Restructuring**: May 28, 2025
- **Enums**: All enums are consolidated in `lib/core/enums/enums.dart` for app-wide calculations (e.g., `QuantityUnit` conversions). Do not split into feature-specific enum files.
- **Themes**: General styling for Information, Warning, and Error cards/messages is in `lib/app/themes.dart`. Use `AppThemes.informationCardDecoration`, `AppThemes.warningBackgroundColor`, etc., for consistent UI across all files.
- **Code Snippets**: When providing changes, include precise line numbers and code references to existing file content to ensure accuracy. this also reduces your load and I dont have to wait for entire code snippet files. 
- **Restructuring Completed**: Folder structure is modular with feature-specific directories (`medication`, `dosage`, `schedule`). `DataProvider` is split into `MedicationProvider`, `DosageProvider`, and `ScheduleProvider` with corresponding repositories.
- **When reviewing and adding new code please make sure to utilise the new folder structure and place the required code , operations, functions and files in their respective directory for efficiency. 

## Features

- **Medication Management**: Add, edit, and delete medications with detailed information (e.g., type, quantity, dose per tablet/capsule).
- **Dosage Tracking**: Create and manage dosage plans for each medication, including support for tablets, capsules, and injections.
- **Reconstitution for Injections**: Calculate and manage reconstitution for injectable medications, with support for different syringe sizes and fluid types.
- **Scheduling**: Set up schedules for dosages with reminders via notifications.
- **Stock Alerts**: Receive notifications when medication stock is low.
- **Modern Design**: A 2025-inspired UI with a teal primary color, coral accents, and the Inter font for a clean, geometric look.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for better accessibility.
- **Consistent Styling**: All views and dialogs use centralized `AppConstants` and `AppThemes` for a cohesive look and feel.

### Folder Structure Restructuring (May 28, 2025)
- **Commit**: `<new_commit_hash>` (Run `git log -1 --pretty=%H` after committing)
- **Details**:
  - Consolidated all enums into `lib/core/enums/enums.dart` for simplicity and shared calculations (e.g., `QuantityUnit` conversions). Renamed from `barrel_enums.dart`.
  - Updated `app/themes.dart` to include general theme styling for Information, Warning, and Error cards/messages. Properties like `AppThemes.informationCardDecoration`, `AppThemes.warningBackgroundColor`, and `AppThemes.errorTitleStyle` are used app-wide for consistent UI.
  - Fixed `Themes` error in `dosage_form_page.dart` and `schedule_form_page.dart` by replacing `Themes` with `AppThemes`.
  - Split `DataProvider` into `MedicationProvider`, `DosageProvider`, and `ScheduleProvider` with corresponding repositories (`medication_repository.dart`, `dosage_repository.dart`, `schedule_repository.dart`) for modular data management.
  - Moved JSON persistence to `database_service.dart` for centralized data storage.
  - Updated `main.dart` to use `MultiProvider` and `AppRoutes` for navigation.
  - Ensured `routes.dart` uses `enums.dart` for routing logic.
  
### Folder Structure Restructuring (May 28, 2025, 17:51 PM AEST)
- **Commit**: `8221e170c72b7656048de81f45a87aa655ad86f3`
- **Details**:
  - Kept enums in `lib/app/enums.dart` for app-wide use (`MedicationType`, `QuantityUnit`, `DosageMethod`, `SyringeSize`, `FrequencyType`, `FluidUnit`, `TargetDoseUnit`). Added `toMLFactor` to `FluidUnit` and `displayName` to `SyringeSize`.
  - Ensured `lib/app/themes.dart` uses `AppThemes` for consistent styling of Information (blue), Warning (orange), and Error (red) cards/messages.
  - Replaced `DataProvider` with feature-specific presenters (`MedicationPresenter`, `DosagePresenter`, `SchedulePresenter`) in `lib/features/*/presenters/*.dart`.
  - Moved `main.dart` to `lib/` and kept `constants.dart`, `themes.dart`, `routes.dart`, `enums.dart` in `lib/app/`.
  - Organized core utilities in `lib/core/utils/` (`format_helper.dart`, `validators.dart`), services in `lib/core/services/` (`database_service.dart`, `notification_service.dart`), and widgets in `lib/core/widgets/` (e.g., `app_bottom_navigation_bar.dart`, `confirm_medication_dialog.dart`).
  - Structured features into `lib/features/*/`: `models/`, `data/repos/`, `ui/views/`, `ui/widgets/`, `presenters/` for `medication`, `dosage`, `schedule`, `home`, `calendar`, `history`, `settings`.
  - Moved `reconstitution_calculator.dart` to `lib/features/medication/utils/` and widgets like `compact_medication_card.dart` to `lib/features/*/ui/widgets/`.
  - Renamed screens to `*_view.dart` (e.g., `medication_form_view.dart`) and providers to `*_presenter.dart` (e.g., `medication_presenter.dart`).
  - Deleted obsolete files: `storage_service.dart`, `data_provider.dart`, `database_service.dart` (in `data/repositories`), `date_utils.dart`, `dosage_form_pageOLD.dart`, `medication_form_pageOLD.dart`.
  - Created new files: `calendar_view.dart`, `confirm_dosage_dialog.dart`, `validators.dart`.
  - Updated all imports to use `app/enums.dart` and new paths, ensuring no deprecated `DataProvider` or `Themes` references remain.
